The ManageIQ bot is the ManageIQ team's helper to automate various developer problems.

## Usage

### Automatic tasks

- Commit monitoring and reaction to commits
  - Detection of Red Hat Bugzilla URLs in commit messages
    - in pull request branches, setting the BZ to ON_DEV if not already set.
    - in regular branches, writing the commit details to the BZ ticket.
  - Detection of Pivotal Tracker stories in commit messages
    - in pull request branches, adding a comment to the Pivotal story.
  - Detection of changes to a product's Gemfile, and setting a label.
- GitHub pull request monitoring
  - Label and comment on a PR when it becomes unmergeable.
  - Run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) and
    [haml-lint](https://github.com/brigade/haml-lint) against a PR diff and
    comment on any offenses found.
- Travis monitoring
  - Detecting stalled builds and automatically restarting them.

### Requested tasks

The bot will react to direct messages in GitHub issues, performing actions on
your behalf which would otherwise not be possible without commit rights to the
repo. Just add a comment to any issue in a monitored repo, with each request on
its own line, in the form `@miq-bot command params`.  Available commands are
below.  Any command can also be pluralized, where sensible, or have the
underscores replaced with hyphens.

- `add_label`: Add one or more labels to an issue.  Multiple labels should be
  comma-separated.  e.g. `@miq-bot add_label label1, label2, label3`
- `remove_label` (or `rm_label`): Remove one or more labels to an issue.
  Multiple labels should be comma-separated.  e.g.
  `@miq-bot remove_label label1, label2, label3`
- `assign`: Assign the issue to the specified user.  The leading `@` for the
  user is optional.  The user must be in the Assignees list.  e.g.
  `@miq-bot assign @user`
- `set_milestone`: Set the specified milestone on the issue. Do not wrap the
  milestone in quotes.  e.g. `@miq-bot set_milestone Sprint 27`

## Development

### Prerequisites

* Ruby 2.2 with bundler
* Redis ~> 2.8.10
* Postgresql

### Setup

1. Fork https://github.com/ManageIQ/miq_bot

2. Clone the miq_bot repo and add the upstream remote:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:<your github handle>/miq_bot.git
   cd miq_bot
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:ManageIQ/miq_bot.git
   git fetch â€”-all
   ```

3. Install any gem dependencies:
   ```
   bundle install
   ```

4. Create the `database.yml` file.
   ```
   cp config/database.tmpl.yml config/database.yml
   ```
   Edit the `database.yml` file, and change `username` and `password` for your
   PostgreSQL database.

5. Set up the databases:
   ```
   bundle exec rake db:setup
   ```

6. Create/fork a test repository and add it to the database (replace `miq-test/sandbox` with your test
   repository below).  Note that the bot account you are using must have SSH keys defined correctly
   if you plan to use an SSH based URL, otherwise you should use an HTTPS based URL.
   ```
   bundle exec rails runner 'Repo.create_from_github!("miq-test/sandbox", "https://github.com/miq-test/sandbox.git")'
   ```

7. Create a custom Procfile for development. Any changes you make to this file
   won't be tracked.
   ```
   cp Procfile.tmpl Procfile
   ```

8. Either start redis as a daemon or have foreman start it for you by
   adding this to the `Procfile`:
   ```yaml
   redis: redis-server /path/to/redis.conf  # change this to the redis.conf provided by your package manager.
   ```

9. Configure the bot settings. First copy the template:
    ```
    cp config/settings.yml config/settings/development.local.yml
    ```

    Then set to the following values:
    ```yaml
    # config/development.local.yml:

    #   Try to use a test account, as the account in question uses notifications
    #   and needs to read them and modify them.
    github_credentials:
      username: "some-test-account"
      password: # account token goes here

    # Optional; leave blank to disable
    gem_changes_labeler:
      enabled_repos: ["miq-test/sandbox"]

    # Optional; leave blank to disable
    graphics_labeler:
      enabled_repos: ["miq-test/sandbox"]

    # Optional; leave blank to disable
    github_notification_monitor:
      repo_names: ["miq-test/sandbox"]

    # Optional; leave blank to disable
    travis_event:
      enabled_repos: ["miq-test/sandbox"]
    ```

10. You should now be able to run `foreman start` to start the services listed
    in the `Procfile`.

11. See `log/development.log` and `log/sidekiq.log` to make sure
    things are starting.

12. You should be able to open a new PR on the miq-test/sandbox
    repository with any rubocop problems, such as `MixedCaseConstant = 1`.
    Wait a few minutes and see if it comments on your PR.

### InfluxDB and Grafana setup

The bot collects some optional data in a time series database
([InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb)) and displays it in an
entirely separate user interface ([Grafana](http://grafana.org/)).

To use these features:

* Install and configure InfluxDB
* Enter the database name and credentials in your local settings yaml
* Install Grafana
* Enter the url of the running Grafana instance in your local settings yaml

Metrics tracking is optional and you should not need to do these extra steps to run miq_bot locally.
